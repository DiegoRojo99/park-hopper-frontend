Welcome to **Park Hopper**—your ultimate companion for a seamless and enjoyable theme park experience! Visit us at [parkhopper.live](https://parkhopper.live).

## Project Overview

**Park Hopper** is a web application designed to make navigating and enjoying theme parks easier and more intuitive. Instead of relying on multiple apps to track wait times, find attractions, or manage your theme park visit, Park Hopper centralizes everything into a single, user-friendly platform.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Waiting Times**: Access up-to-date waiting times for attractions, shows, restaurants, and more, all in one place using data from the [Theme Parks API](https://api.themeparks.wiki/docs/v1/).
- **Favorites Management**: Easily track your favorite attractions with a simple click. No more sifting through long lists—your top picks are always at your fingertips.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you’re planning your visit from home or navigating the park on the go, Park Hopper is fully responsive and optimized for all devices.
- **Future Enhancements**: We’re working on exciting new features, including personalized wait time alerts, social sharing options, and more, to make your theme park experience even better.

### How It Works

Park Hopper utilizes the [Theme Parks API](https://api.themeparks.wiki/docs/v1/) to fetch real-time data from various theme parks. Users can explore different park destinations, view detailed information about attractions, and add them to their personalized favorites list. Soon, you’ll also be able to set up alerts for waiting times, ensuring you never miss the perfect moment to visit your favorite ride.
